# Semantic editions



::: {.callout-warning title="TBA"}

- goals of the project
- work to date
:::



I use the term *semantic edition* for a digital edition that aims to encode the entire contents, textual and non-textual, of a physical document.



I list here examples of some of the non-textual contents I have worked with digitally:

-   Tools for multilingual reading: the Complutensian polyglot Bible
-   Datasets for geographic maps: Ptolemy, *Geography*:
-   Precomputed mathematical functions: Ptolemy, *Almagest*:
-   Proofs with mathematical figures: Euclid, *Geometry*; Archimedes, *Spiral Lines*
-   Grammatical inflectional tables
-   Chronological computation: Jerome's *Chronicles*
-   Documents with ancient Greek musical notation (including manuscripts of Alypius)
-   Manuscripts with musical notation in neumes
